    "## The Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "You're a Data Analyst at **TechSalary Insights**. Your manager needs answers to critical business questions, but the data is messy. Your job is to clean it and provide accurate insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The catch:** You must figure out how to clean the data yourself. No step by step hints just you, your AI assistant, and real world messy data.\n",
    "\n",

    "## The Dataset: Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "**Location:** `../Week-02-Pandas-Part-2-and-DS-Overview/data/Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021 (Responses) - Form Responses 1.tsv`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **real survey data** from Ask A Manager's 2021 salary survey with over 28,000 responses from working professionals. The data comes from this survey: https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this dataset is perfect for vibe coding:**\n",
    "- Real human responses (inconsistent formatting)\n",
    "- Multiple currencies and formats  \n",

    "## Your Business Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer these **exact questions** with clean data. There's only one correct answer for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Questions (Required):\n",
    "1. **What is the median salary for Software Engineers in the United States?** \n",
    "2. **Which US state has the highest average salary for tech workers?**\n",
    "3. **How much does salary increase on average for each year of experience in tech?**\n",
    "4. **Which industry (besides tech) has the highest median salary?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus Questions (If time permits):\n",
    "5. **What's the salary gap between men and women in tech roles?**\n",
    "6. **Do people with Master's degrees earn significantly more than those with Bachelor's degrees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria:** Your final answers will be compared against the \"official\" results. Data cleaning approaches can vary, but final numbers should be within 5% of expected values.\n"

    "**Summarize your findings here:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Median salary for Software Engineers in US:** $145,000\n",
    "2. **Highest paying US state for tech:** California\n",
    "3. **Salary increase per year of experience:** $11,348.36\n",
    "4. **Remote vs office percentage:** Do not think this is correct, 0.1% remote, 99.9% in person\n",
    "5. **Highest paying non-tech industry:** Pharmaceutical/biotechnology\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insights:**\n",
    "- I dont think my code is completely correct, but industries outside of tech, like sports or healthcare, have high median salaries, showing that tech and medicine aren't the only high-paying fields.\n",
    "- Cleaning the data and making sure your variable names are correct is very important, and one mistake with naming can change the entire solution. If you're vibe coding, the LLM can change the variable names from the ones you like to use, messing up the data. \n",
    "- We took the median in this challenge because the mean can be easily skewed by something like an outlier or a group of people who earn a lot. The median is a good way to find the middle balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges faced:**\n",
    "- I did not like how vibe coding cleaned and renamed the data. I solved this by using my own skills and renaming it myself.\n",
    "- The salary data was stored as strings with symbols and commas, which made calculating it difficult. I fixed this by cleaned the column by removing the symbols and converting it to a numeric format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you learned about vibe coding:**\n",
    "- I learnt that although vibe coding is very popular and can be useful, it is sometimes harder to use than just coding yourself. You have to be really careful and go step by step, but even then it can be confusing and the LLM can go in a different direction from what you want. It also gets super confusing, since you ask the LLM to do one thing, and it gets very complicated and provides a solution that you have to take a long time to understand\n",
    "- You have to be very specific with what you want. You must give the LLM the variables you want to use, and the methods you want to avoid.\n",
    "- Vibe coding may give you more complicated solutions than the human coded ones.\n"
